                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Daniel Hënn. I currently live in a small town in the North West province of South Africa.<br>
                    I enjoy reading, gaming, art, and working out. I also occasionally play the guitar.<br>
                    I'm currently working on qualifying in my chosen field of study: Full Stack Web & Software Engineer.
                </p>
                <h4>My Goals:</h4>
                    <p>
                        I want to be financially independent, and to use my learned skills
                        in a practical manner that has a positive impact on the world around me.<br>
                        I want to be able to help those in need, people and animals.
                    </p>
                <h4>My Future Aims:</h4>
                    <p>
                        I would like to travel and see the world, to experience different cultures and points of view.<br>
                        I would also like to work in game development, and bring new worlds to life.
